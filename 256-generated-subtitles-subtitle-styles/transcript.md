## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi, I'm James and I'm an engineer on the AVFoundation team.
- [00:11] I love to travel, so today,
- [00:14] I'll take you on a trip to explore a couple of features related to subtitles.
- [00:18] People use subtitles for many reasons.
- [00:21] Subtitles are vital for people who are deaf or hard of hearing,
- [00:25] or who have other accessibility needs.
- [00:28] They need subtitles to understand the content.
- [00:31] Some people read subtitles to assist in understanding the spoken dialogue.
- [00:37] I use subtitles when I physically can't hear the audio,
- [00:40] like when I'm in a busy airport.
- [00:43] Apple AI-generated subtitles can be created live,
- [00:47] locally on the device as the media plays.
- [00:51] In this video, first,
- [00:53] I'll show you how the Apple AI-generated subtitles appear in your app.
- [00:58] Afterwards, I'll show the subtitle style preview feature
- [01:02] that lets people customize subtitles while playing video.
- [01:06] Next, I'll show how media assets are authored.
- [01:10] The media creation journey usually begins with filming
- [01:14] and editing the Video and Audio content.
- [01:17] Then, subtitles, text that represents spoken words in the audio,
- [01:22] are created manually.
- [01:24] Later in this video, I'll refer to such subtitles as Authored subtitles.
- [01:30] The content author can create multiple subtitles,
- [01:33] each for one particular language.
- [01:36] Also, they can create multiple audio languages.
- [01:39] The final media contains the Video, Audio and Authored subtitles all together.
- [01:46] Even content with multiple audio and subtitle languages
- [01:50] might not have a language the viewer understands.
- [01:54] People can have their device create generated subtitles to help fill the gap
- [01:59] when the original content doesn't have the subtitle language they need.
- [02:04] This enables more people to access and experience the content.
- [02:10] Next, this is how generated subtitles are created.
- [02:14] There are two use cases for generated subtitles.
- [02:17] In the first use case, subtitles are generated from audio.
- [02:22] The source audio goes into the on-device Speech-To-Text model
- [02:27] and subtitles are created.
- [02:30] This is called Speech transcription.
- [02:33] Second, for language translation,
- [02:36] subtitles are generated from other subtitles.
- [02:40] The source subtitles, English in this case,
- [02:43] go into the on-device translation model.
- [02:46] New subtitles in a different language are created, Italian, for example.
- [02:51] This is called Language translation.
- [02:54] Generated subtitles provide additional languages.
- [02:58] The authored subtitles are preferred and remain unchanged.
- [03:03] The good news is that you don't need to implement anything
- [03:06] to turn on generated subtitles.
- [03:09] They're available automatically during video playback.
- [03:14] Generated subtitles are provided for many playback scenarios.
- [03:18] Subtitles can be generated for HTTP live streaming content,
- [03:22] including Live streams, like TV channels.
- [03:26] It also includes Video on demand movies and shows,
- [03:29] including travel videos and live events, like sports.
- [03:35] File-based content is also supported,
- [03:38] like app-bundled videos or downloaded media.
- [03:43] Several content types are supported.
- [03:46] Professional content, like movies and series, is supported.
- [03:51] So is customer-created content,
- [03:54] like camera capture from the iPhone and social media videos.
- [03:59] Now, I'll show you the supported devices and languages.
- [04:03] Generated subtitles are available on multiple devices.
- [04:07] This table shows the supported devices and languages.
- [04:11] Starting in iOS and macOS 27,
- [04:14] English subtitles can be generated from English audio.
- [04:18] This is also supported on tvOS and visionOS 27.
- [04:23] Also, multiple subtitle languages
- [04:26] can be generated from English subtitles on iOS and macOS.
- [04:31] Now that you know about generated subtitles,
- [04:33] I'll talk about how to present them in your app.
- [04:37] It's important to provide subtitle selection UI during video playback.
- [04:42] Here are the options for your app.
- [04:45] This is the AVPlayerViewController UI on iOS.
- [04:49] It fully implements subtitle selection and player controls.
- [04:53] You don't need to do anything extra.
- [04:56] AVPlayerView on macOS provides similar functionality.
- [05:01] This is AVLegibleMediaOptionsMenuController.
- [05:05] It presents subtitle selection controls and implements the behavior.
- [05:10] It's a good choice when you want to add subtitle selection UI
- [05:13] to your existing player UI, since it does not provide player controls.
- [05:19] Or, you can implement custom controls for media selection
- [05:23] to match the style of other controls in your app.
- [05:27] Like the ones I created here in my app.
- [05:30] Generated subtitles make the content in your app more accessible.
- [05:35] More people can understand and enjoy the content.
- [05:39] Now I'll show you another subtitle feature that makes your app even more accessible.
- [05:45] Subtitles help make content accessible,
- [05:47] but the presentation of the subtitles is also important.
- [05:51] The Settings app has let people select
- [05:54] and change subtitle and caption styling for many years.
- [05:58] There are a few built-in styles,
- [06:00] and people can create custom styles to fit their needs.
- [06:04] I've created a custom style called Bold Yellow.
- [06:08] It has yellow text with a little extra border
- [06:11] to make it easier for me to read.
- [06:13] I can select the style in the Settings app,
- [06:16] but it would be easier, and more accessible,
- [06:19] to change the style while watching a video.
- [06:22] That's exactly what the subtitle style preview does.
- [06:26] I'm watching a video and I have the Style menu open.
- [06:30] I have the same styles available that were in the Settings app.
- [06:34] The subtitle style can now be changed right from the menu
- [06:38] where you select subtitles during video playback.
- [06:41] Not only that, but a preview of the style is shown to make selection easier.
- [06:47] This is what my Bold Yellow style looks like in a video.
- [06:51] There are several ways
- [06:52] to implement the subtitle style preview feature in your app.
- [06:56] First, this is AVPlayerViewController on iOS.
- [07:00] It fully implements the subtitle style preview and player controls.
- [07:05] AVPlayerView on macOS provides similar functionality.
- [07:10] This is AVLegibleMediaOptionsMenuController.
- [07:14] It presents subtitle style preview controls and implements the behavior.
- [07:19] It's a good choice when you want to add the subtitle preview
- [07:22] to your existing player UI.
- [07:25] Next, AVPlayerLayer has an API to show the style preview.
- [07:29] I'll show you how to implement it in a moment.
- [07:32] Also, AVCaptionRenderer can provide the style preview,
- [07:37] but you are responsible for rendering it.
- [07:39] Now, here's the AVPlayerLayer implementation.
- [07:43] Each subtitle style in the system is assigned a profile ID.
- [07:48] First, fetch all of the styles by their profile IDs.
- [07:52] Populate your UI with the names for the styles.
- [07:56] When a style is selected, show the stylized preview.
- [08:00] New subtitles are shown using the specified style.
- [08:04] Any existing subtitles are automatically hidden
- [08:07] so they don't interfere with the preview.
- [08:10] Pass nil for the text parameter.
- [08:13] In that case, localized system text is shown.
- [08:16] Use the position parameter to avoid any UI controls.
- [08:20] This is an offset from the default location of the preview text.
- [08:25] Call this function again to show a different style.
- [08:28] You can call it as many times as needed.
- [08:32] Stop the preview when selection is done.
- [08:35] This removes the preview text
- [08:37] and restores any existing subtitles that are active.
- [08:41] Set the chosen style.
- [08:43] It will be used for all subtitles on the system.
- [08:47] You can build this feature in your app to let people quickly choose subtitles
- [08:51] that are easier to read while watching a video.
- [08:55] Now, I will show you both of these subtitle features together.
- [08:59] I'm planning a camping trip to Italy.
- [09:02] I'm going to watch this camping video for some inspiration.
- [09:06] It's has English subtitles, but I want Italian subtitles,
- [09:10] so I can brush up on my Italian.
- [09:13] To change the language, I'll open the Subtitles menu,
- [09:16] then click Language.
- [09:19] Several subtitles are available.
- [09:21] Some are authored and some generated.
- [09:24] The generated options are marked with a sparkle symbol
- [09:28] and the word Translated.
- [09:30] I'll pick the Italian generated subtitles.
- [09:34] Now I have Italian subtitles in my video.
- [09:43] I'll change the style to make them easier to read.
- [09:47] First, I'll open the Subtitles menu, then select Style.
- [09:51] I'll try Large Text.
- [09:54] The existing subtitles have been replaced with a placeholder message,
- [09:58] in Italian, using the Large Text styling.
- [10:02] The text is larger, but let me try my custom style.
- [10:09] Oh, I like that.
- [10:11] I'll dismiss the menu.
- [10:14] The subtitles are now using my custom style.
- [10:17] This trip is going to be amazing.
- [10:20] Before I go, here are your next steps.
- [10:23] Now that you know about the generated subtitles feature,
- [10:26] I encourage you to go explore it.
- [10:29] For example, watch some travel videos and turn on generated subtitles.
- [10:34] Also, make sure your app has UI to select subtitles.
- [10:38] Implement the subtitle style preview too.
- [10:41] People appreciate this accessibility feature
- [10:44] when they need to change the style of their subtitles.
- [10:48] Thank you for watching.
- [10:49] I have to go catch a plane to Italy.
- [10:51] Ciao ciao.
