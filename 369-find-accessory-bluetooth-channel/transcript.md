## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi! I'm Gretchen and I work on Core Bluetooth.
- [00:11] Today, I'm excited to introduce a way to find nearby Bluetooth accessories,
- [00:16] using Channel Sounding.
- [00:19] First, I will give you some ideas for how you could use Channel Sounding,
- [00:23] and how it works.
- [00:25] Then I will explain how to implement it in your app,
- [00:28] using Core Bluetooth to get distance,
- [00:32] or with Nearby Interaction to get distance and direction to your accessory.
- [00:38] Next,
- [00:39] I will give you some tips for building hardware that supports Channel Sounding.
- [00:44] And I will end with some next steps.
- [00:47] Let's start with an overview.
- [00:51] Imagine I am hosting a party.
- [00:55] I am cooking inside using my oven,
- [00:57] and I have a smoker going in the backyard.
- [01:01] I have Bluetooth thermometers in both places,
- [01:04] to help me cook everything perfectly.
- [01:07] I get a notification,
- [01:09] that one of my thermometers has reached the temperature I set.
- [01:13] When I open the app, it says the probe is 8 meters to my right.
- [01:19] That must be the smoker!
- [01:21] With Channel Sounding, I won't mix up my temperature probes.
- [01:25] I can measure distance to each one!
- [01:29] There are a couple ways to measure distance
- [01:31] and direction to third-party accessories on iOS.
- [01:36] For the best accuracy,
- [01:38] you can add an Ultra Wideband chipset to your accessory
- [01:42] and use the Nearby Interaction framework in your app.
- [01:46] For more information on this,
- [01:49] watch the video "Explore Nearby Interaction with third-party accessories".
- [01:55] But if your accessory only has a Bluetooth chipset,
- [01:58] then Bluetooth Channel Sounding is your best option.
- [02:02] You might have used RSSI in the past to estimate distance,
- [02:07] but with Channel Sounding you can actually measure distance.
- [02:11] We encourage you to try Channel Sounding,
- [02:13] where your app could benefit from better accuracy.
- [02:16] So, how exactly does Channel Sounding work?
- [02:21] Let's say we have an iPhone that is paired and connected to a Bluetooth accessory.
- [02:27] In this scenario, the iPhone is called an initiator
- [02:32] and the accessory is called a reflector.
- [02:35] The iPhone sends a signal, or tone, to the accessory,
- [02:40] and the accessory reflects that tone back.
- [02:44] The iPhone measures how the signal changes in transit,
- [02:48] from one side, to the other, and back.
- [02:53] By repeating this process across the channels of the 2.4GHz band,
- [02:58] the iPhone observes the rate of change in these reflected tones,
- [03:03] from one channel to the next,
- [03:05] and uses that to estimate the distance between the initiator and reflector.
- [03:11] This process of measuring distance is called a procedure.
- [03:16] So, how do you perform Channel Sounding in your app?
- [03:21] If you just need distance, you can use Core Bluetooth.
- [03:25] Before you begin,
- [03:26] you'll want to ensure your accessory is paired and set up,
- [03:29] using AccessorySetupKit, and connected through Core Bluetooth.
- [03:34] You can refer to the documentation for more on how this is done.
- [03:38] Now let's look at the code to measure distances.
- [03:43] First, check that Channel Sounding is supported on the local iOS device,
- [03:47] using CBCentralManager.supportsFeatures method.
- [03:52] Once you have a connected CBPeripheral, call startChannelSoundingSession
- [03:58] on the CBPeripheral object.
- [04:01] iOS will repeatedly perform Channel Sounding procedures.
- [04:06] When each procedure is completed,
- [04:09] the delegate method peripheral didReceive results
- [04:13] will be called with the measured distance in meters.
- [04:18] When you are ready to complete your Channel Sounding session,
- [04:22] call cancelChannelSoundingSession.
- [04:26] When the session ends,
- [04:27] the delegate method peripheral didCompleteChannelSoundingSession will be called.
- [04:34] Next,
- [04:35] I'll tell you how to use Nearby Interaction
- [04:37] to measure distance and direction.
- [04:41] Again,
- [04:42] ensure your accessory has been paired and set up through AccessorySetupKit,
- [04:46] and connected via CoreBluetooth.
- [04:48] Before creating a Channel Sounding session,
- [04:51] check whether the local iOS device supports it,
- [04:55] with the supportsBluetoothChannelSounding method.
- [05:00] Then create a configuration object,
- [05:03] passing in the peripheral.identifier from CoreBluetooth
- [05:06] as the bluetoothChannelSoundingIdentifier.
- [05:11] In order to get direction, CameraAssistance is required.
- [05:15] Be sure to enable this if you need it.
- [05:20] Finally, create your NISession,
- [05:23] set the delegate,
- [05:24] and run it with the new accessory configuration you just created.
- [05:29] If your app knows whether the accessory is moving or stationary,
- [05:33] you can tell Nearby Interaction,
- [05:35] and it will use that information to produce better direction estimates.
- [05:40] Call updateMotionState on your session with your accessory object.discoveryToken.
- [05:47] For example,
- [05:49] if your accessory is a mounted tag on a wall, pass .stationary.
- [05:54] If it's attached to a moving object, pass .moving.
- [05:59] The delegate callback is identical to what you'd get with UWB.
- [06:04] You will receive NINearbyObjects updates with distance and direction.
- [06:11] Both the distance and the direction results
- [06:13] benefit from the fusion of raw Bluetooth Channel Sounding measurements
- [06:17] and camera inputs.
- [06:20] Remember that both, distance and direction, are optional.
- [06:25] Distance may be nil, if the Channel Sounding measurement failed.
- [06:31] iOS automatically filters outliers
- [06:34] and smooths your results for a better user experience.
- [06:38] In iOS 27, use Channel Sounding when your app is in the foreground.
- [06:43] When your app moves to the background,
- [06:45] your Channel Sounding session will be paused.
- [06:49] Also be aware,
- [06:50] that iOS may reduce the frequency of Channel Sounding measurements,
- [06:54] if other Bluetooth or Wi-Fi activity increases.
- [06:59] Channel Sounding is available on iPhones with the N1 chip.
- [07:05] Now I will explain how to make your accessories work well,
- [07:09] with Channel Sounding on iOS.
- [07:12] Your accessory must support Bluetooth 6.3,
- [07:16] and the inline PCT feature is required.
- [07:20] iOS uses phase based ranging,
- [07:23] so your chipset must also support mode-0 and mode-2,
- [07:27] as defined by the Bluetooth spec.
- [07:32] T_FCS is the interspace timing between tones.
- [07:36] Make sure your accessory supports T_FCS of at least 100µs.
- [07:42] Alright, you've heard all about Channel Sounding, but what's next?
- [07:47] Try out the APIs with a compatible accessory.
- [07:51] Imagine how measuring distance would improve how people interact with your app.
- [07:56] Ask your questions on the Developer Forums
- [07:59] and send us feedback using Feedback Assistant.
- [08:02] Thank you!
