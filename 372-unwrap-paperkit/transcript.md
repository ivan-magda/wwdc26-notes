## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi, I'm Matt, an engineer on the Pencil and Paper team.
- [00:12] Apps that give users a canvas to create whatever they want,
- [00:15] have been some of the most iconic and empowering experiences on Apple platforms.
- [00:19] And PaperKit is what powers the canvas experience
- [00:22] across many of Apple's own applications.
- [00:25] When you sketch an idea, drop in an image,
- [00:27] or mark up a document in Notes, that's PaperKit.
- [00:31] It's the full canvas experience, pencil, shapes, text, images,
- [00:37] all working together.
- [00:39] When you open a PDF in Preview and add a signature, highlight a passage,
- [00:44] or circle something important, that's PaperKit too.
- [00:49] And when you're ideating in Freeform on macOS, that's also PaperKit.
- [00:54] And in iOS, macOS and visionOS 27, PaperKit opens up.
- [00:59] Today I'll show you how to unwrap PaperKit,
- [01:02] so you can take full control over your canvas experience.
- [01:06] I'll start with the data model,
- [01:07] which gives you access to everything on the canvas.
- [01:11] Then, I'll show you how to work with elements like shapes and images.
- [01:16] And I'll finish with adornments,
- [01:18] which let you add interactive overlays and controls.
- [01:22] Let's get going with the data model.
- [01:25] I've been building a comic book editor powered by PaperKit.
- [01:28] I've already set up some basic templates.
- [01:31] But that's as far as I got.
- [01:32] Now I need to turn those templates into PaperMarkup.
- [01:36] PaperMarkup has a new subelements property.
- [01:39] It gives you access to every element on the canvas as a MarkupOrderedSet,
- [01:43] which is an ordered collection you can read from and write to.
- [01:47] This code snippet creates a shape element for each panel.
- [01:51] And then update's the markup.
- [01:54] That's it.
- [01:56] Let's try this on the iPad.
- [01:58] I'll add a three-page panel to my comic.
- [02:01] Great. It's showing up exactly how I wanted.
- [02:04] The canvas is fully interactive,
- [02:05] which is a problem for my comic book editor.
- [02:08] I can select the panels, drag them around and even delete them.
- [02:15] That's not what I want.
- [02:17] The template elements should not be editable.
- [02:20] To fix this, I need to change how those shape elements behave.
- [02:24] Every element on the canvas conforms to the Markup protocol.
- [02:28] This gives you common properties like frame and rotation.
- [02:32] There is also a new allowedInteractions property,
- [02:34] which is a MarkupInteractions option set.
- [02:37] It gives you fine-grained control over what can be modified on each element.
- [02:42] Markup interactions lets you control moving, resizing and rotating,
- [02:47] deleting, styling, and selecting, individually or in any combination.
- [02:54] And if you want to lock down everything at once,
- [02:57] read-only combines them all into a single flag,
- [03:00] which is perfect for the comic template.
- [03:03] To limit interactions with panels in the comic book editor,
- [03:06] I need to set .allowedInteractions to .readOnly.
- [03:10] I'll give it a try.
- [03:12] Now when I tap a panel border,
- [03:15] nothing happens.
- [03:16] The template shapes are read-only.
- [03:18] I can add a speech bubble, move that around,
- [03:23] and stylize it,
- [03:27] but the panels stay fixed.
- [03:29] Perfect.
- [03:30] The app is starting to take shape, but the panels need to really pop,
- [03:34] so I've added a color picker in the toolbar for styling our template.
- [03:41] To implement styling, I'm going to dive into elements.
- [03:45] Every element in PaperMarkup has a concrete type.
- [03:49] Shapes, images, links, loupes, and pencil strokes.
- [03:54] They are all part of the same Markup ordered set,
- [03:57] and conform to the Markup protocol.
- [04:00] But each of these types have their own custom properties.
- [04:03] Let's take a deeper look at shapes.
- [04:06] PaperKit supports many shape types
- [04:08] and each type has its own properties, like corner radius for rounded rectangles,
- [04:13] or control points for curved lines.
- [04:16] I used rectangles for the comic panels.
- [04:19] They have a stroke color and that's what we're looking for.
- [04:22] To apply a color to our panels, I need to iterate over the subelements.
- [04:27] Then set their stroke and fill colors.
- [04:31] To give it that extra pop,
- [04:33] I'm going to use the same color for the markup background.
- [04:36] And lastly I update the markup on the paperMarkupViewController.
- [04:41] Let me check the result on the iPad.
- [04:46] And just like that, the canvas transforms.
- [04:49] The page is styled with the color I chose,
- [04:52] and it's starting to unwrap into something more personal.
- [04:55] PaperKit is built on top of PencilKit, so I can use the Apple Pencil to draw.
- [05:02] Each stroke becomes a markup element
- [05:04] and I can use all of the PencilKit model APIs.
- [05:08] Those APIs now support character recognition
- [05:10] and Bézier path conversion.
- [05:12] For all the details,
- [05:13] check out "Reading Between the strokes with PencilKit".
- [05:17] Now let's look at how to add custom controls with adornments.
- [05:22] I want to add a button to each panel that lets users create artwork.
- [05:25] But I don't want those controls to become part of the document.
- [05:29] They shouldn't be saved, printed, or exported.
- [05:32] I want them to exist on top of the canvas, only when I'm editing.
- [05:36] That's exactly what Markup adornments are,
- [05:39] a visual overlay anchored to canvas coordinates.
- [05:42] This makes adornments ideal for buttons, annotations, and collaboration UI.
- [05:47] They automatically track zoom and scroll,
- [05:50] and they're completely separate from the persisted markup.
- [05:53] For each panel, I create a MarkupAdornment.
- [05:56] I anchor it to the center of the panel,
- [05:58] and I give it an SF Symbol icon through the imageConfiguration.
- [06:03] Then I assign the array to the controller's adornments property.
- [06:08] To handle taps,
- [06:09] I implement the delegate method didTapAdornmentWithID.
- [06:14] When the user taps an adornment,
- [06:16] I present the ImagePlaygroundViewController.
- [06:21] When an image comes back from Image Playground, I create an ImageMarkup.
- [06:25] Then, I insert it into the subelements and update the view controller's markup.
- [06:31] Let's give it another try.
- [06:34] I'll tap one of the panels to create some artwork.
- [06:39] My comic is going to be about a super hero dog
- [06:41] fighting crime in the city.
- [06:49] And the generated image fills the panel.
- [06:53] To learn more about generating images in your app,
- [06:56] watch "Create high-quality images using Image Playground".
- [07:01] And now with just a couple more images, some text and fonts,
- [07:04] I've got the first page of my comic.
- [07:08] Our super hero dog is going to save the day.
- [07:11] Now you can build a fully interactive,
- [07:13] canvas-based experience in your app with PaperKit.
- [07:17] Use the data model to programmatically read and modify what's on the canvas.
- [07:22] And add adornments to create interactive overlays tailored to your app.
- [07:26] I can't wait to see how you will unwrap PaperKit.
- [07:29] Thanks for watching!
