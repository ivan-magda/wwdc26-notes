- [00:07] Hi, I'm Andrew, and I work on the commerce team at Apple.
- [00:10] In this session,
- [00:11] I'm excited to explain how you can offer subscriptions to groups and organizations.
- [00:16] Subscriptions have become increasingly important for developers,
- [00:19] serving as an excellent way to offer continuous value to customers.
- [00:23] However, there are times when a subscriber wants to get their social group,
- [00:26] team, or company on your app.
- [00:29] For example, a company wants to give their team of editors, video editing software,
- [00:33] or members of a run club want to keep each other motivated and accountable
- [00:36] through an exercise app.
- [00:38] To address those needs,
- [00:39] you will be able to sell subscriptions to groups and organizations,
- [00:43] with two ways for your customers to purchase and manage them.
- [00:47] When you list your subscription on the App Store,
- [00:49] you can now offer them to groups and organizations through two new paths.
- [00:54] Customers can make group purchases through your app,
- [00:57] just like they make in-app purchases today…
- [01:00] And, through a brand new channel for subscriptions
- [01:02] through volume purchasing in Apple Business and Apple School Manager.
- [01:06] With volume purchasing an organization, like a business or school,
- [01:10] can purchase subscriptions through the App Store,
- [01:12] inside Apple Business and Apple School Manager.
- [01:15] They can use a device management service
- [01:17] to assign seats through the same workflows
- [01:19] they already use for distributing apps at scale.
- [01:23] This is a perfect solution for organizations with larger scale
- [01:27] and requirements for management and identity.
- [01:31] With group purchases,
- [01:32] Customers purchase subscriptions from your app just like they do today.
- [01:36] But instead of only purchasing for themselves,
- [01:38] they purchase multiple seats for your plan.
- [01:41] Then, all they need to do is share an invite link
- [01:44] with anyone they want to give access to your plan.
- [01:47] When they accept, they'll automatically get a seat assigned.
- [01:51] This is perfect for small teams or social groups to collaborate on apps.
- [01:56] In this session, I will cover what you need to consider
- [01:58] to offer subscriptions to groups and organizations.
- [02:01] I'll start by covering availability,
- [02:03] for subscriptions for groups and organizations.
- [02:06] Next, I'll discuss how you can set up pricing.
- [02:10] After that, I'll explain how purchasing works.
- [02:13] And I'll wrap up with seat management.
- [02:17] These new options are available for all auto-renewable subscriptions
- [02:20] using StoreKit 2.
- [02:23] For most new and existing subscriptions using StoreKit 2,
- [02:27] the ability to sell to groups and organizations is on by default.
- [02:31] If your subscription has Family Sharing enabled,
- [02:33] you can still sell to groups and organizations,
- [02:36] but it is opted-out by default so you can control how the two options work for you.
- [02:41] Subscriptions are available for both group purchases within your app,
- [02:44] and for volume purchasing in Apple Business and Apple School Manager.
- [02:49] In App Store Connect, you can make changes to this.
- [02:52] You can choose to make a subscription available only on Apple School Manager,
- [02:56] allowing you to create plans with specific pricing
- [02:59] for verified educational institutions.
- [03:03] And you also have the option to turn off
- [03:06] selling to groups and organizations entirely.
- [03:08] If you do so, your subscription won't be available for volume purchasing
- [03:12] in Apple Business and Apple School Manager,
- [03:15] or group purchases within your app,
- [03:17] but you will still be able to sell your subscription
- [03:20] to individuals on the App Store.
- [03:24] Next, I'll discus how you can set up pricing for these subscriptions.
- [03:28] By default,
- [03:29] every seat of your subscription is sold at the current price in App Store Connect.
- [03:33] If you want to offer bulk discounts,
- [03:35] you will be able to use a new pricing configuration, volume pricing.
- [03:40] With volume pricing, you can offer reduced pricing for larger purchases.
- [03:45] You can set up to 5 price bands,
- [03:48] with full control over the quantities required for each band, and the price.
- [03:53] Next, I'll share an example of how you could use volume pricing,
- [03:56] to offer reduced pricing at purchases of over 20 seats and over 40 seats.
- [04:03] To accomplish that, you will need to set up 3 bands.
- [04:07] The first band, would be set at your standard price,
- [04:09] in this example the subscription is $19.99 per month per seat until 20 seats.
- [04:15] For the next band of seats, between 21 and 40,
- [04:18] each seat is discounted to $13.99.
- [04:22] And for seat number 41 or greater, it's $10.99 per seat.
- [04:27] In this example of a purchase of 50 seats,
- [04:30] the average cost per seat for the subscriber,
- [04:32] comes down about 20% from the base price.
- [04:35] Volume pricing gives buyers an incentive,
- [04:37] to cover larger groups and consolidate purchasing.
- [04:40] It's configured directly in App Store Connect.
- [04:43] Next, I will cover how groups and organizations purchase your subscriptions.
- [04:49] With volume purchasing, Apple Business and Apple School Manager,
- [04:52] display your subscriptions and handle the purchase process.
- [04:55] All you need to do is make sure your subscription
- [04:58] is available to organizations.
- [05:02] For group purchases,
- [05:03] you make your own in-app UI to trigger the StoreKit 2 purchase flow.
- [05:07] Consider how you can highlight the value,
- [05:09] of a group purchase during your app's merchandising flows,
- [05:11] to encourage customers to use a subscription with their social group,
- [05:15] or team.
- [05:16] After merchandising,
- [05:18] you'll need to get the number of seats requested from your customer
- [05:20] and pass that into the StoreKit 2 purchase request.
- [05:25] To wrap up, I'll discuss how seats are assigned and managed
- [05:28] after the purchase is complete.
- [05:31] Your customers purchase the number of seats they need,
- [05:34] either through volume purchasing or group purchases.
- [05:37] With volume purchasing, the organization assigns seats to their members,
- [05:41] the same way they assign apps today, through a device management service.
- [05:45] This makes it easy for them to assign seats at large scale,
- [05:48] and ensure they are owned and managed by the organization.
- [05:53] With group purchases,
- [05:54] an invitation link will be generated for the initial purchaser
- [05:57] to share with members.
- [05:59] When assignments are completed from either purchase type,
- [06:02] the App Store assigns a transaction for each member,
- [06:04] and you can give them access.
- [06:07] If you want group purchases without building the infrastructure,
- [06:10] by default, group purchases will use the included seat management system,
- [06:14] which covers, generating the invitation link,
- [06:17] tracking member acceptance and assignment
- [06:19] and Seat life-cycle management for your application, like cancellations.
- [06:23] All you need to do is start a purchase request and Apple will take it from there.
- [06:27] And,
- [06:28] if you already implement an invitation and member management system for your app,
- [06:32] you can leverage it.
- [06:33] Integrating custom invitation flows,
- [06:35] will be powered via new App Store Server API endpoints.
- [06:40] If your app offers collaborative features
- [06:42] or access to shared resources for members under the same subscription,
- [06:46] you can use the App Store Server API Group management endpoints,
- [06:49] to access information about a group.
- [06:51] You'll be able to access all the groups that a single customer is in,
- [06:55] and all of the members in a group.
- [06:58] These endpoints are supported for volume purchasing
- [07:00] and group purchases using the included seat management flows.
- [07:05] As I wrap up, start thinking now
- [07:07] about how your application can take advantage of group purchases
- [07:10] and volume purchasing to extend the reach of your app.
- [07:13] Make sure you are using StoreKit 2 if you aren't using it already.
- [07:17] StoreKit 2 is required to offer subscriptions to groups and organizations.
- [07:21] Next, consider how group purchases, volume purchasing, and volume pricing,
- [07:25] might impact your availability and pricing strategies,
- [07:28] for both new and existing subscriptions.
- [07:31] Finally, consider new or existing collaborative experiences
- [07:34] you could add or improve in your app for groups or organizations.
- [07:38] I'm so excited to see how offering subscriptions to groups and organizations,
- [07:42] enables you to reach more customers.
- [07:44] Thank you for being a part of the Apple developer community!
