## Transcript

- [00:07] When someone discovers your app on the App Store,
- [00:10] what they see in those first few moments,
- [00:14] drives whether they'll want to learn more about your app, or scroll past it.
- [00:18] Today, I'll show you new ways to use images and videos to shape that moment.
- [00:24] Hi, I'm Ruhi, an engineering manager on the App Store Connect team.
- [00:30] First, a quick recap of how your app currently appears on the App Store.
- [00:36] The product page, screenshots and previews,
- [00:39] give people a glimpse into your app,
- [00:41] by highlighting the experience or key features.
- [00:45] Similarly when your app is shown in the Search Results,
- [00:48] by default, screenshots and previews are shown.
- [00:52] Here's what's changing for these two places on the App Store!
- [00:56] First, your Product Page can now have a Header,
- [01:00] and here you have the freedom to use images and videos, outside of your app screenshots and previews.
- [01:09] Product Page Header is the first visual element
- [01:12] people will see when they land on your app and a compelling asset can spark interest.
- [01:18] Use this new real estate, to express your visual identity or brand.
- [01:24] These assets can be images,
- [01:27] or videos.
- [01:29] Videos can be a great addition,
- [01:31] allowing you to control the narrative of how someone perceives your app.
- [01:37] Your Product Page Header, app icon and screenshots work together,
- [01:42] to give people a clearer picture of what your app is all about.
- [01:48] Now, I'll discuss what's changing for App Store Search Results.
- [01:54] Instead of showing the default app screenshots,
- [01:57] you can use an impactful image or video,
- [02:01] to make your app stand out in the Search Results.
- [02:04] Choose assets that clearly communicate your app's core value and features,
- [02:10] in a way that encourages people to tap and learn more about your app.
- [02:16] You can also use these images and videos to create Ads
- [02:21] to boost your app's discovery.
- [02:24] Set them up on the Today tab or Search Results using Apple Ads.
- [02:30] Additionally, leverage these assets with Custom Product Pages,
- [02:35] to better connect with your audience.
- [02:37] I'll illustrate how you can do that with a few examples.
- [02:42] Exercise App's website is marketing Yoga classes
- [02:46] with a banner on top to get the app.
- [02:50] And the website is linked to the app's Custom Product Page.
- [02:54] Now, you have the ability to customize the header,
- [02:58] and use the same marketing visuals that you used on your website.
- [03:03] Additionally, when people download the app,
- [03:06] you can deep-link them directly into the Yoga offering,
- [03:10] for a consistent experience from app discovery to installation.
- [03:15] Using Custom Product Pages,
- [03:17] you can also show a tailored asset for different search keywords,
- [03:22] to make your app's search result more relevant and compelling.
- [03:28] Similar to the website example,
- [03:30] consider using the same assets on your header,
- [03:33] as your Search Results, for a seamless customer experience.
- [03:38] Additionally, use Product Page Optimization in App Store Connect,
- [03:43] to test different visuals and see exactly which ones your audience respond best to,
- [03:49] whether it's your app's logo, core value or a new feature.
- [03:54] Apps and games across all the categories on the App Store,
- [03:58] can take advantage of these images and videos.
- [04:02] For example, outdoor apps could show aspirational imagery.
- [04:07] Travel apps could promote popular destinations.
- [04:10] Or games could showcase gameplay or interesting characters.
- [04:15] You can update your product page header and search result visuals,
- [04:19] on both iOS 27 and iPad OS 27.
- [04:24] Now, I'll discuss how to setup this rich media using App Store Connect.
- [04:30] There are 2 ways to submit to App Review.
- [04:33] First, the flow that you are familiar with, through your app's version page.
- [04:38] On your version page, upload the assets that you intend to use.
- [04:43] Then use the new Preview functionality,
- [04:47] to review how your app looks on the App Store with these new assets.
- [04:54] You can view them for both iPhone and iPad,
- [04:57] across different orientations and languages.
- [05:01] Once you make sure that everything looks good,
- [05:04] submit your version for review like you do today.
- [05:07] Once your version is approved and released,
- [05:10] the assets on your Product Page Header and Search Results,
- [05:13] are also live on the App Store.
- [05:16] The second way to submit these assets for review,
- [05:19] is through the new Asset Library in App Store Connect!
- [05:24] Asset Library, is a centralized place to manage all your app's assets,
- [05:29] across platforms, sizes and the different placements.
- [05:33] Asset Library includes, your existing screenshots, preview videos,
- [05:38] in-app event media and your new marketing images and videos.
- [05:43] And these new marketing visuals,
- [05:45] are called creative assets, in App Store Connect.
- [05:52] Similar to the version submission,
- [05:54] first, upload your creative assets directly to Asset Library.
- [05:59] Once you have uploaded, submit them for review.
- [06:03] In this flow, you submit your creative assets standalone,
- [06:07] without updating your version,
- [06:10] or indicating where you plan to use them in the future.
- [06:15] So your assets can be approved,
- [06:16] either as part of your app version submission,
- [06:19] or directly through the Asset Library flow.
- [06:22] Once they are approved,
- [06:23] all of them are available in your Asset Library.
- [06:27] One big advantage of Asset Library, is that approved assets
- [06:32] are ready to be used across your app's Product Page Header and Search Results,
- [06:37] without going through additional reviews.
- [06:40] I'll illustrate with an example!
- [06:43] This is the current Product Page Header with a summer hiking asset.
- [06:48] And these are some approved assets in the Asset Library.
- [06:52] A winter hiking asset is selected, to replace the summer asset,
- [06:57] publishing changes directly to the App Store without a new submission.
- [07:03] And there it is!
- [07:04] Cool!
- [07:07] Getting your assets approved ahead of time,
- [07:09] gives you the flexibility to update your app's Product Page Header
- [07:13] and Search Results in real-time.
- [07:16] To automate these flows, you can upload and submit to Asset Library,
- [07:20] using the App Store Connect API as well.
- [07:24] Additionally,
- [07:25] you can use the Apple Ads Platform API to automate ad setup flows,
- [07:30] which includes open-source client libraries for Swift and more.
- [07:36] As a next step, start preparing the images and videos,
- [07:40] that you'll use to showcase your app on the App Store.
- [07:43] Then, upload your assets to Asset Library,
- [07:47] for use on your Product Page, Search Results, and more.
- [07:51] Finally preview your app before you submit for review.
- [07:56] I am very excited to see how you use these new visuals,
- [08:01] for your app on the App Store and what it unlocks for you!
- [08:05] Thank you for watching!
