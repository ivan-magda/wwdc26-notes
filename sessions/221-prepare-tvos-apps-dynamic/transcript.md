## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi, I'm Isis, and I'm an engineering manager on the accessibility team.
- [00:12] This year, there is great news for accessibility on tvOS 27.
- [00:18] Large Text support is now available,
- [00:20] bringing system-wide text scaling to every app on the platform.
- [00:25] Many people need or prefer different text sizes,
- [00:28] and making your app dynamic helps everyone get a great experience.
- [00:32] Your tvOS app customers have been waiting for this accessibility feature.
- [00:36] And I'll show you how to make the most out of it in your apps.
- [00:40] In addition, you'll be able to indicate support for Larger Text
- [00:43] in your Accessibility Nutrition Labels for tvOS in the App Store.
- [00:48] This is a great way to reach users who specifically look for accessible apps
- [00:52] that support larger text.
- [00:55] In this session, I'll start by covering how Large Text works on tvOS
- [00:59] and where people can find it.
- [01:02] Then, I'll go into identifying small parts of your app
- [01:05] that you may need to adjust for larger text sizes.
- [01:09] And finally, I'll touch on a few examples
- [01:12] of how to adapt layout in response to text size.
- [01:16] Let's start with an overview.
- [01:17] If you're familiar with Dynamic Type on iOS,
- [01:20] you have a head start!
- [01:21] Dynamic Type works the same way on tvOS.
- [01:25] UIKit and SwiftUI can adapt text sizes automatically
- [01:30] based on what someone prefers.
- [01:32] This gives people control over the text size
- [01:34] to match their needs and comfort.
- [01:38] People can turn on larger text sizes in the Settings app.
- [01:41] By navigating to Accessibility, Display, then Text Size.
- [01:47] They'll have the option of choosing text sizes
- [01:49] starting at Large all the way up to Accessibility XXXL.
- [01:56] I'm working on a media app
- [01:57] that lets people discover and watch their favorite movies.
- [02:01] Here's how this app adapts to these larger text sizes.
- [02:05] This media app has a tab bar at top for navigation.
- [02:08] There's a large title, with a few action buttons,
- [02:12] and a gallery of movie posters to explore in a collection view below that.
- [02:16] With larger text sizes turned on, the navigation title at the top
- [02:20] has become much larger.
- [02:23] In the tab bar, each label is now bigger,
- [02:26] and all of the text throughout the interface has scaled up significantly.
- [02:31] Standard UIKit and SwiftUI components
- [02:34] like Labels, Buttons and Navigation tabBars
- [02:37] handle this automatically.
- [02:40] For your apps, your job is just to identify and update
- [02:43] any custom elements that may need attention.
- [02:47] When examining your app with Large Text,
- [02:49] there are a few types of issues to identify.
- [02:52] When your app runs with larger text sizes,
- [02:54] you'll want to ensure that you avoid fixed font sizes
- [02:58] that don't allow your text to scale.
- [03:01] Interfaces that don't adapt to dynamic type,
- [03:03] like hard-coded sizes or constraints,
- [03:05] may cause issues like truncation of text
- [03:09] or clipping of UI elements.
- [03:11] You may also need to adjust layouts for the padding and spacing needed
- [03:15] when some elements grow to larger sizes.
- [03:19] Here's an example from my media app
- [03:21] where the description of a movie is displayed.
- [03:24] There is a title shown at the top,
- [03:26] with text labels and controls towards the bottom.
- [03:30] With text set to the largest size, most of the text has grown larger…
- [03:35] But, there's one text element on the left that isn't scaling.
- [03:40] That is the caption that reads "Signup information"
- [03:43] above the controls that let someone sign up,
- [03:45] buy, or rent a movie.
- [03:48] Now, a caption like this may have hard-coded text sizes
- [03:51] for a specific layout reason.
- [03:53] For example, it might have originally been in a container
- [03:57] with static dimensions or rigid constraints.
- [04:00] While this can seem appealing for creating predictable layouts,
- [04:03] it's not recommended.
- [04:05] This approach lacks flexibility and can't adapt to larger text.
- [04:10] Instead, adapt the layout to be flexible and remove the hard-coded values.
- [04:15] Here is the code representing the Description View of my media app.
- [04:20] It has a VStack, containing the "Signup information" caption,
- [04:24] and an HStack containing the buttons
- [04:26] and other text information about the movie.
- [04:29] This code contains a few different challenges for larger text.
- [04:33] It specifies a fixed font size, which will not adapt
- [04:37] when someone changes their size preference.
- [04:41] And on the Text view,
- [04:42] there is a fixed width constraint to 300 points.
- [04:46] As text grows, 300 points may not be wide enough for the text,
- [04:50] which could lead to text truncation.
- [04:53] To make this caption adjust to larger text sizes,
- [04:56] I'll replace the hard-coded font style with a semantic text style.
- [05:00] In this case, I'll use "caption".
- [05:03] With those changes, the text size is now dynamically growing,
- [05:07] but the content is now truncated.
- [05:11] To fix this, replace fixed widths with flexible constraints
- [05:14] that let the view grow as needed.
- [05:17] On the text view, I'll replace the fixed width
- [05:20] with the parameter maxWidth
- [05:22] and set it to infinity.
- [05:24] This tells SwiftUI to use as much width as needed for the content.
- [05:29] With those changes, my text view scales beautifully with larger text,
- [05:34] and has enough space to display its content.
- [05:37] Perfect!
- [05:38] To find these types of common issues in your app,
- [05:41] search for hard-coded text sizes
- [05:43] and migrate to standard styles instead.
- [05:47] Search your app for hard-coded height and width constraints
- [05:50] and use flexible constraints to allow your content to grow.
- [05:55] If you're using UIKit, the approach is similar
- [05:58] with one additional step.
- [06:00] Replace hard-coded fonts with text styles,
- [06:03] and set adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory to true.
- [06:08] This tells UIKit to automatically update when preferences change.
- [06:13] Sometimes fixing hard-coded values isn't enough.
- [06:17] You may want to adapt the layout in response to larger text,
- [06:20] while preserving the original layout for default sizes.
- [06:25] Consider this collection view.
- [06:27] It contains six movie posters with a title underneath each.
- [06:31] With a standard text size,
- [06:33] the full title fits comfortably in the space below the image.
- [06:37] With Large Text enabled,
- [06:39] there isn't enough room to fit six titles horizontally.
- [06:43] This layout will need to be adapted when the text is larger.
- [06:48] Here is the SwiftUI code for the view.
- [06:50] It presents a horizontal scroll view, with a LazyHStack.
- [06:55] Inside a container, I have a button for each cell.
- [06:59] To adapt this layout,
- [07:01] I will first read the dynamicTypeSize environment key path.
- [07:05] Then, I'll change the columnCount parameter on the cell
- [07:09] in the containerRelativeFrame modifier.
- [07:13] When larger text sizes are enabled,
- [07:15] I'll set the layout to show 4 columns at a time, instead of 6.
- [07:21] This provides wider cell dimensions and gives each title more room to grow.
- [07:26] To accommodate even longer text, consider a custom marquee strategy.
- [07:32] Here's another example where I'll adjust layout in this app.
- [07:36] This part of my app contains cards for different types of content,
- [07:40] like a video of a beach, or a video of camping.
- [07:44] Each of these content cards contains an image,
- [07:46] the title, and a subtitle.
- [07:49] With larger text, there isn't enough visual padding between elements,
- [07:53] and text is easily truncated with the space that it has.
- [07:58] One solution is to provide a conditional layout
- [08:00] for when larger sizes are turned on.
- [08:03] Here's how a conditional layout can be achieved in SwiftUI.
- [08:07] First, read the dynamicTypeSize environment value
- [08:10] to detect when accessibility sizes are turned on.
- [08:14] Then, create a VStackLayout or an HStackLayout
- [08:17] depending on whether larger text is being used.
- [08:21] AnyLayout lets you abstract over these two types.
- [08:25] Use the new layout like any other stack.
- [08:27] It will dynamically switch between horizontal and vertical
- [08:30] depending on the text size.
- [08:33] In UIKit, use UIStackView and update the axis property
- [08:37] based on preferredContentSizeCategory. isAccessibilityCategory.
- [08:44] Call registerForTraitChanges and pass UITraitPreferredContentSizeCategory
- [08:49] to update your layout in response to size changes while your app is running.
- [08:55] Here it is in action in my app's content cards.
- [08:59] When larger text sizes are enabled, the layout switches to a vertical stack.
- [09:04] This lets the title and subtitle grow to the entire width of the cell,
- [09:08] rather than sharing the width with the image.
- [09:11] This layout also allows the cells to become taller to provide more room
- [09:16] for the content.
- [09:18] Now you're ready to test your app with larger text sizes on tvOS.
- [09:23] Discover where you can make refinements by using system text styles
- [09:26] and tailoring your layouts to prioritize text legibility.
- [09:31] Here's your action plan.
- [09:33] Use standard text styles instead of hard-coded fonts.
- [09:37] Test systematically with Large Text enabled.
- [09:42] Adapt layouts when needed for best experience.
- [09:46] And indicate support for Larger Text
- [09:48] in your app's Accessibility Nutrition Labels for tvOS.
- [09:54] Now it's your turn to make your tvOS app accessible for everyone!
- [09:58] Thanks for watching!
