## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi!
- [00:08] My name is Duraid and I'm a member of the Shortcuts team.
- [00:12] With Shortcuts, you can combine actions that you perform in your apps every day
- [00:17] and quickly run them from different places across the system,
- [00:21] like Siri,
- [00:22] Control Center,
- [00:24] Action Button,
- [00:25] and more.
- [00:27] In this session, I'm going to share some exciting improvements coming to Shortcuts
- [00:32] and how you can make your app's actions and content fit right in.
- [00:37] I'll start by going over updates to the way automations are set up,
- [00:41] and a set of new automation types that are available.
- [00:44] Next, I'll go over the Use Model action and a new way to debug its behavior.
- [00:49] And finally, I'll cover storage, a feature that lets you persist
- [00:53] data between runs of a shortcut.
- [00:56] Let's dive in!
- [00:57] With automations, you can make your shortcuts run automatically in response to events,
- [01:03] for example, here's a shortcut that runs every time I leave work.
- [01:07] It calculates my route home, and sends a message to my partner Helen
- [01:11] with my estimated time of arrival.
- [01:15] Automations now live directly in the Shortcuts editor,
- [01:17] alongside the actions that run in a shortcut
- [01:20] and they're easier to set up than ever.
- [01:22] To browse them and add one to a shortcut, you can visit
- [01:26] the "Automation" section in the editor.
- [01:29] In addition to the current set of automations,
- [01:31] there are also three new types available:
- [01:34] the screenshot automation, which runs when a screenshot is saved,
- [01:38] the keyboard automation, which triggers when an external keyboard
- [01:42] is connected or disconnected,
- [01:44] and the notification automation, which runs when
- [01:47] a notification is received from a specific app.
- [01:51] I'll dive into an example of how I can use the notification automation
- [01:54] with an app I'm working on.
- [01:57] This is Soup Chef, an app that allows me to browse soups and order them for delivery.
- [02:03] When a soup delivery is close, my app sends a notification
- [02:06] with the driver's name, and how soon to expect them.
- [02:10] I like to turn my porch lights on when I get that notification
- [02:14] so the driver can find the door when it's late at night.
- [02:18] I'd love for that to happen automatically!
- [02:21] To do this, I've created a shortcut that turns on my porch lights,
- [02:25] and has my living room HomePod announce that my soup is about to arrive.
- [02:29] The notification automation is triggered when I receive
- [02:32] a notification from the Soup Chef app.
- [02:35] I don't want it running for every notification from the app
- [02:38] so I've added a filter for the word "arriving."
- [02:41] That way, it only runs when the app is notifying me that my soup is arriving.
- [02:46] Now, my delivery person will always have a safe, well lit walk up to my front door.
- [02:54] This works well because my app provides a concise, informative notification.
- [02:59] The driver's name makes it distinct, the verb "arriving" makes it specific,
- [03:04] and the time until arrival makes it actionable.
- [03:07] These details make the notification easy to parse and interpret within a shortcut.
- [03:14] If you follow the best practices for designing notifications
- [03:17] in the Human Interface Guidelines,
- [03:19] your users will be able to harness your notifications to build
- [03:22] powerful automations like this one.
- [03:25] Next, I'll talk about the Use Model action.
- [03:28] The Use Model action lets you tap into the power of large language models,
- [03:33] directly within your shortcuts.
- [03:35] Now, it's more powerful than ever.
- [03:38] With access to new, more capable Apple Intelligence models
- [03:42] that have the ability to go out to the web for up-to-date information.
- [03:47] All of these models can work with content from your apps,
- [03:50] like this example, where the action is able to find the events
- [03:53] related to my upcoming trip to Montreal,
- [03:56] when a large list of upcoming events is passed in.
- [03:59] Let's go back to the Soup Chef app.
- [04:02] I'd like to build a shortcut that picks a soup I'll like
- [04:04] and lets me quickly order it.
- [04:06] I'll call it Soup of the Day.
- [04:10] To build this, my shortcut will need access to my app's soup data.
- [04:14] Using an EntityPropertyQuery in App Intents,
- [04:18] I've already exposed a Find Soups action
- [04:20] that fetches all soups from my app with the ability to filter
- [04:23] to the ones available today.
- [04:26] I've also built an action called Order Soup,
- [04:29] which takes a soup as a parameter, asks me to confirm, and places the order.
- [04:35] I'll start building my shortcut
- [04:36] by stringing these together with the Use Model action.
- [04:41] This shortcut finds today's available soups, then uses a model to pick one
- [04:45] that matches my spice level preference.
- [04:48] Let's run it!
- [04:54] It picked a chicken tortilla soup.
- [04:56] But in Soup Chef, that's one of the milder options on the menu.
- [05:00] I'm looking for something spicier.
- [05:03] When a model produces a result you didn't expect, you might want to know exactly
- [05:07] what the model saw, so you can understand what went wrong.
- [05:11] There's a way to do exactly that: you can now inspect the model transcript
- [05:16] and see everything that was passed to the model, in its raw format.
- [05:20] I'll add a Show Content action right after the Use Model action.
- [05:24] Next, I'll select the Transcript property on its output in the Show Content action.
- [05:31] And now, when I run my shortcut, I can see the transcript.
- [05:37] Here, I can see the exact soup entities that were passed to the model
- [05:42] and I can expand each one to understand exactly what the model saw.
- [05:47] Here is the structured representation of a Soup entity that was passed to the model.
- [05:52] And these are the properties exposed on that entity.
- [05:56] With just the name and availability,
- [05:58] the model doesn't have enough to accurately judge spice level.
- [06:02] Adding an ingredients property, which lists each ingredient and its quantity,
- [06:07] should give the model what it needs.
- [06:10] Let's add that.
- [06:12] Here's my SoupEntity.
- [06:14] It exposes properties for the name and availability of a given soup.
- [06:20] Let's add ingredients here as well
- [06:22] as a simple array of strings.
- [06:26] Each string will contain an ingredient and its quantity per serving.
- [06:31] I've removed the "Show Content" action that was used to debug,
- [06:35] and I'll try running the shortcut again with the change.
- [06:39] Now that the model has access to each soup's ingredients,
- [06:42] it picked a Tom Yum soup that has some real heat!
- [06:46] I think I'll order that one!
- [06:49] For more on building App Intents for the Use Model action,
- [06:52] check out
- [06:53] "Develop for Shortcuts and Spotlight with App Intents" from WWDC25.
- [06:59] Finally, I'll talk about Storage!
- [07:01] With Storage, you can now save content within a shortcut,
- [07:05] to persist it between runs.
- [07:08] In the shortcuts editor, there's now a view that allows you to create, view,
- [07:12] and edit the values that are stored in a shortcut.
- [07:15] You can also create a global value which is shared across multiple shortcuts.
- [07:20] This is useful for data you need to access in more than one shortcut, like an API key.
- [07:26] These three actions enable you to retrieve and update this data
- [07:30] from within your shortcut,
- [07:32] unlocking so many possibilities:
- [07:34] from simple shortcuts that count or log items, like daily coffees,
- [07:39] to advanced ones that track richer context across runs.
- [07:43] Let's take a look at how I can use storage to improve a shortcut I use every day.
- [07:49] I closely follow motor racing,
- [07:51] and I have a shortcut that shows me a technical fact every morning!
- [07:55] The Use Model action is designed to be deterministic
- [07:59] which is great when you want predictable model output.
- [08:02] But for this shortcut, I want fresh facts every morning.
- [08:07] I can use the Storage actions to achieve this.
- [08:11] I'll start by retrieving a stored value that I'll name "Previous Facts".
- [08:15] That'll be my list that contains every past fact.
- [08:20] Next, I'll pass it to the model, and ask the model
- [08:23] to stay away from these previous facts.
- [08:26] Once the model responds with a fact,
- [08:28] I'll use the "Add to List" action which outputs a list with the new fact appended.
- [08:34] I can use the setter action to store the new list.
- [08:38] Now, my shortcut will come up with something new every day!
- [08:42] The great thing is that storage works with any type of data in Shortcuts,
- [08:46] including App Entities.
- [08:48] Using Storage, I'd like to make a final improvement
- [08:51] to my Soup of the Day shortcut.
- [08:53] I've noticed that when I run it, the model often picks the same
- [08:56] soup several days in a row.
- [08:59] I want to give the model a memory of recent selections
- [09:01] so it can pick a different one every day.
- [09:04] Just like my motor racing example, I'll use the Storage actions here.
- [09:09] With that, the Use Model action knows not to repeat past picks.
- [09:15] And now, once I've run the shortcut a few times, when I open the storage view
- [09:20] there's a list of previous soups!
- [09:22] I've been building and running this shortcut on my iPhone, but the great thing
- [09:26] is its stored values sync across my devices, so if I'm using my iPad,
- [09:31] I can run the shortcut there and it'll remember my past soups.
- [09:36] Because these values sync across devices, entities need a consistent identity
- [09:40] across every device.
- [09:42] An entity saved on iPhone should be identified by your iPad or Mac app
- [09:47] as the same entity.
- [09:49] For example, here's a simple shortcut that retrieves a stored soup
- [09:53] and passes it into my "Order Soup" intent.
- [09:56] Since the stored value may have originated on a different device, the order intent
- [10:01] needs to recognize the soup no matter which device originally stored it.
- [10:07] To make this work, I ensured my identifier comes from a source that produces
- [10:11] the same value on every device, not one that varies per device.
- [10:16] My Soup app is backed by an online database of soups,
- [10:19] so I use each soup's database row ID as its stable entity identifier.
- [10:25] So those are some of the new capabilities coming to Shortcuts!
- [10:28] Next, try building shortcuts that integrate with your app
- [10:31] to get a sense of what your users might want to automate.
- [10:35] Refine your notifications so your users can build powerful automations.
- [10:40] And finally, test your App Entities to make sure they play well
- [10:44] with the Use Model action and Storage in Shortcuts.
- [10:48] "Your soup is almost here."
- [10:50] Well, time to go pick up my soup!
- [10:53] Thanks for joining me!
