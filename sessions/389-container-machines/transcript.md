## Transcript

- [00:07] Hi, my name is Michael,
- [00:09] and today I want to introduce a new feature built on top of Containerization.
- [00:15] Containerization is a swift framework for running Linux containers,
- [00:20] with a focus on security, privacy, and performance.
- [00:25] Linux containers are a great way to build, test, and deploy server-side applications.
- [00:33] Building on this foundation, Container machine,
- [00:36] is a new feature that provides a highly integrated Linux environment,
- [00:41] that works seamlessly on your Mac.
- [00:44] A Container machine is fast and lightweight, like a container,
- [00:48] and persistent like a virtual machine.
- [00:52] Along with host integrations, a Container machine feels native to macOS.
- [00:58] Before learning more, about Container machine,
- [01:00] lets take some time to review the Containerization framework.
- [01:05] Then, we will look the design principles that shaped Container machine.
- [01:10] Finally, we will explore how Container machine
- [01:13] provides a seamless workflow for cross-platform development.
- [01:19] At WWDC 25 we open sourced Containerization.
- [01:25] Containerization is a Swift framework for running Linux containers on macOS.
- [01:30] It provides APIs for storage, networking, execution, and a Linux init system.
- [01:38] It is designed to provide each container with Virtual machine based isolation.
- [01:44] These lightweight Virtual machines are performant,
- [01:46] and provide sub-second start times.
- [01:50] Along with Containerization, the container tool was open sourced.
- [01:55] It provides CLI commands for image creation, distribution,
- [01:59] and lifecycle management for Linux containers.
- [02:03] If you want to learn more about the overall architecture of Containerization
- [02:07] and the container tool, watch "Meet Containerization" from WWDC 25.
- [02:14] Now, let's take a look at the design principles for container machine.
- [02:19] These environments should be fast and lightweight,
- [02:22] to integrate into existing workflows.
- [02:25] Switching between macOS and Linux should be easy.
- [02:29] Users should be able to customize and create new environments quickly.
- [02:34] Quick creation allows multiple projects to have their own, dedicated environment,
- [02:40] without the worry of conflicting dependencies or toolchains.
- [02:45] Different tools and dependencies are often required during the development lifecycle.
- [02:52] Having a persistent environment,
- [02:54] allows additional tools to be added and used over time.
- [02:58] Finally, these Linux environments should integrate into your existing work-flow.
- [03:03] Developing for multiple platforms shouldn't involve a large context switch.
- [03:09] There shouldn't be the need to learn new tools,
- [03:11] when targeting a different environment.
- [03:14] We kept these design principles in mind when building Container machine.
- [03:19] A Container machine must be fast and lightweight.
- [03:22] They must be simple to manage.
- [03:25] They must provide persistence, allowing users to revisit over time.
- [03:29] And a Container machine must feel like an extension of macOS.
- [03:34] With these design principles in mind,
- [03:36] lets look at how Container machine improves cross platform workflows.
- [03:41] Building on top of Containerization,
- [03:44] each Container machine runs inside of its own, lightweight virtual machine,
- [03:48] and use the same image format as containers.
- [03:52] It is a first class feature of the container tool and has a familiar UX.
- [03:57] Images built with the container tool,
- [04:00] can to be used as the starting point for a new Container machine.
- [04:05] A Container machine is stateful and persists modifications made
- [04:09] while you are working in it.
- [04:11] Start and stop projects as needed,
- [04:13] Container machine ensures your environment can continue where you left it.
- [04:19] And with automatic user mapping, shared filesystem support,
- [04:23] and the ability to enter your Linux environment,
- [04:26] no matter where you are in a terminal,
- [04:28] Container machine provides a smooth transition,
- [04:32] from macOS into Linux, and back again.
- [04:36] Now, lets see Container machine in action.
- [04:39] Lets start with container machine.
- [04:48] This shows an overview of the actions we can perform,
- [04:51] including ones like create, run, and stop.
- [04:56] To create a new Container machine, I'll use container machine create.
- [05:03] I'll provide it a name and set it as the default machine on my Mac.
- [05:09] This way, we don't have to provide the name for every command.
- [05:14] Container machine uses the same OCI images that containers use.
- [05:19] A common container image is alpine.
- [05:25] Great, our Container machine is created.
- [05:29] Next, I want to execute commands inside of this Container machine.
- [05:34] I'll use container machine run to execute the echo command.
- [05:48] Great, let try this with uname.
- [05:53] On macOS uname prints Darwin.
- [05:57] Container machine run uname, prints Linux, reflecting the runtime environment.
- [06:05] Container machine automatically mirrors your username
- [06:08] and current working directory from your Mac.
- [06:11] If I run whoami on my Mac, it returns Michael.
- [06:16] Running pwd shows that I'm located in my user's home directory on macOS.
- [06:23] Lets run an interactive shell inside of the Container machine.
- [06:27] Container machine run,
- [06:29] without additional arguments, will start an interactive session.
- [06:36] From inside my container machine, running whoami and pwd,
- [06:41] returns the same username and path from my Mac.
- [06:51] Great!
- [06:55] Automatic user creation, filesystem sharing,
- [06:58] and having a consistent working directory results in a seamless experience.
- [07:03] Lets explore more, by looking at an application I'm building.
- [07:07] I have a Vapor-based web server that I'd like to run and deploy on Linux.
- [07:13] For my work-flow, I edit the project using Xcode on my Mac.
- [07:18] I use macOS tools, to edit images for the application.
- [07:23] I'll build and run this in Linux,
- [07:25] then, test my changes on macOS by accessing the web server from Safari.
- [07:32] Let's work on this application.
- [07:34] In the terminal, running ls shows my project files.
- [07:40] I have a Package.swift, my Source code, and a Public directory holding assets.
- [07:47] I have a Container machine with the swift toolchain installed.
- [07:51] container machine list will display the name,
- [07:54] IP address, and resource information of all my Container machines.
- [08:07] I will copy the IP address for later.
- [08:14] I'm ready to test my application in Linux.
- [08:17] I'll start with an interactive shell,
- [08:19] inside of my Container machine, by running container machine run.
- [08:29] With automatic directory sharing, all my project files are available.
- [08:37] My Container machine has an isolated network.
- [08:41] For Safari on my Mac to access the web server,
- [08:44] running inside the Container machine,
- [08:47] I need to ensure that Vapor listens on the external interface.
- [08:52] Let's update the server's configuration in Xcode.
- [08:57] I will set the configuration's hostname to the IP address of my Container machine.
- [09:03] We copied this value earlier.
- [09:05] I edited this file in Xcode on my Mac,
- [09:09] but these changes are already available to my Container machine.
- [09:13] Moving back to my terminal,
- [09:15] I'm ready to compile and run my application.
- [09:19] Great, the server is running so lets view our site in Safari.
- [09:23] I will open Safari and paste the IP for my container machine,
- [09:27] into the address bar.
- [09:29] I will also add port 8080.
- [09:33] Great, access works and I could stare at this all day!
- [09:39] But, let's make one last change.
- [09:41] I used Icon Composer, to create the storage icon on screen.
- [09:46] I want to change the icon's background to a gradient.
- [09:50] I will open my existing icon file, in Icon Composer to make this change.
- [10:03] Now, I will export this icon to my project and overwrite the existing file.
- [10:15] Without copying files into my Container machine,
- [10:18] I expect refreshing the page in Safari, to automatically display my updated icon.
- [10:24] Lets go back to Safari.
- [10:27] Great! my update is working.
- [10:33] Container machine builds on the usability and speed of containers,
- [10:38] with the persistence of a Virtual machine.
- [10:41] The seamless integrations provide a Linux environment
- [10:44] that feels like an extension of your Mac.
- [10:48] We're excited for you to try out Container machine.
- [10:51] Download the latest release of the container tool on Github.
- [10:55] We look forward to your feedback.
- [10:57] Thanks for watching!
